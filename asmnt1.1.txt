java is a platform independent language because program executes anywhere( platform having jre ) if it is 
sent after compiling.

In java source code can be compiled on windows and the compiled code can be executed on any platform running a jvm.
As java code can run on multiple platforms it is platform independent.

The java compiler “javac” compiles the source code and produces the platform independent code called bytecode.
 
The byte code generated by the compiler is not native to any platform.
For example, byte code generated on Windows is same as the byte code generated on Linux for the same java code.

Byte code can’t be directly executed by any CPU because not generated according to any platform.

JVM translates the platform independent byte code into platform dependent executable code according to the native platform.

Platform dependent executable generated by the JVM is executed by the CPU.

java code can be written once and executes any where.
